## Sales Scripts for Dashboard Upsell

### **Existing Client Conversion**
*"[Client name], I've been tracking your GMB performance since we completed the optimization, and the results are fantastic - you're getting 40% more profile views and 25% more phone calls. But here's what's interesting..."*

*"I've been manually tracking this data for you, and I realized you should be able to see these results in real-time, not just when I send monthly reports. Plus, I can show you exactly how much revenue this is generating for your business."*

*"I've built a dashboard that shows your GMB performance 24/7, compares you to competitors, and calculates the exact ROI of our work together. Want to see it?"*

### **New Client Pitch**
*"Most GMB optimization services are 'set it and forget it' - they do the work once and disappear. But Google My Business is like a garden - it needs ongoing attention to keep growing."*

*"That's why I include a performance dashboard with all my optimization projects. You can see your results in real-time, track your ROI, and get recommendations for continuous improvement."*

*"The optimization is €400, and the ongoing dashboard service is €300/month. But here's the thing - most clients see the dashboard pay for itself within the first month through increased business."*

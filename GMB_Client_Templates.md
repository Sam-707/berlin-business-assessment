### **Proposal Follow-up**
```
Subject: Your Google optimization proposal - any questions?

Hi [Name],

I sent over the Google My Business optimization proposal yesterday and wanted to check if you had any questions.

Just to recap what's included for ‚Ç¨400:
‚úÖ Complete profile optimization
‚úÖ Professional photo session (15+ photos)
‚úÖ Keyword-optimized description
‚úÖ First month of Google Posts
‚úÖ Review response strategy
‚úÖ 30-day visibility guarantee

Most clients see results within the first week - more profile views, phone calls, and direction requests.

The next available start date is [date]. Should I reserve that spot for [Business Name]?

Any questions at all, just reply or call me at [phone].

Best regards,
[Your name]

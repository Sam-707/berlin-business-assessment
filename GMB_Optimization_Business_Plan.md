## Common Objections & Responses

### **"I don't have time for this"**
*"That's exactly why you need this service. I handle everything - you just need to give me 30 minutes for photos and then it's done. Most clients see more customers within 2 weeks."*

### **"Google is free, why should I pay?"**
*"Google is free, but being found on Google isn't automatic. 90% of businesses do it wrong and lose customers to competitors. I make sure you're in that top 10% that actually gets found."*

### **"I already get enough customers"**
*"That's great! But what happens during slow seasons or if a competitor opens nearby? A strong Google presence is insurance for your business. Plus, wouldn't you rather choose your customers instead of hoping they find you?"*

### **"I'll do it myself"**
*"You absolutely could! It just takes about 20 hours to do it right, plus ongoing maintenance. Most business owners tell me their time is worth more than ‚Ç¨20/hour. I can have this done professionally in a week."*

### **"‚Ç¨400 is too expensive"**
*"I understand budget is important. Let me ask - how much is one new customer worth to you? Most businesses tell me ‚Ç¨100-500. If this brings you just 2-3 new customers, it pays for itself. Plus, the optimization lasts for years."*

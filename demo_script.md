## Opening (2 minutes)

**"Hi [Client Name], thanks for taking the time to chat today. I'm excited to show you something that's going to change how you think about your Google My Business results."**

**"You remember when we optimized your GMB listing [X months ago]? You've been getting more calls and customers, right? Well, I've been tracking your performance behind the scenes, and the results are actually incredible. But here's the problem - you can't see these results in real-time, and you don't know exactly how much revenue this is generating for your business."**

**"I've built a dashboard that solves both of those problems. It shows you exactly how your GMB listing is performing 24/7, and more importantly, it calculates the exact ROI of our work together. Want to see it?"**

*[Wait for yes, then share screen]*

## Dashboard Walkthrough (10 minutes)

### **Section 1: Performance Overview (3 minutes)**

**"This is your GMB performance dashboard. Let me show you what's been happening since we optimized your listing."**

*[Show main metrics]*

**"Look at these numbers - in the last 30 days, your GMB listing generated:**
- **[X] profile views** - that's people finding your business on Google
- **[X] phone calls** - direct calls from your Google listing  
- **[X] direction requests** - people driving to your location
- **[X] website clicks** - visitors to your website

**"See this green arrow? That's a [X]% increase compared to before our optimization. Most businesses have no idea these numbers even exist, let alone track them."**

### **Section 2: ROI Calculator (4 minutes)**

**"But here's the really powerful part - the ROI calculator."**

*[Navigate to ROI section]*

**"Based on your [X] customer actions this month, and using your average customer value of €[X], this dashboard estimates that your GMB listing generated approximately €[X] in revenue this month."**

**"Let me put this in perspective:**
- **Your GMB optimization cost**: €400 one-time
- **Estimated monthly revenue from GMB**: €[X]
- **ROI**: [X]% return on investment

**"That means our work together has already paid for itself [X] times over, and it keeps generating revenue every single month."**

### **Section 3: Competitive Intelligence (3 minutes)**

**"And here's something really cool - competitive intelligence."**

*[Show competitor comparison]*

**"I track your main competitors automatically. Look at this - you're outperforming [Competitor A] in photos and reviews, but [Competitor B] is posting more frequently. This gives you actionable insights to stay ahead."**

**"Most business owners are flying blind - they have no idea how they compare to competitors. You'll always know exactly where you stand and what to improve."**

## Value Proposition (3 minutes)

**"So here's what this dashboard gives you that no other GMB service in Berlin offers:**

1. **Real-time visibility** - See your performance 24/7, not just in monthly reports
2. **ROI tracking** - Know exactly how much revenue your GMB listing generates
3. **Competitive intelligence** - Always know how you compare to competitors
4. **Automated alerts** - Get notified immediately if something needs attention
5. **Professional reports** - Impress your stakeholders with data-driven insights

**"This isn't just pretty charts - this is business intelligence that helps you make better decisions and grow faster."**

## Pricing and Close (5 minutes)

### **The Soft Close**

**"Now, I could keep providing this manually like I have been, sending you monthly reports and tracking everything behind the scenes. But that's not scalable for either of us, and you deserve to see this data in real-time."**

**"The dashboard service is €300 per month, which includes:**
- Real-time performance tracking
- Monthly ROI reports  
- Competitive analysis
- Automated alerts
- Ongoing optimization recommendations
- Priority support from me

### **The ROI Justification**

**"But here's the thing - based on what we just saw, this dashboard is tracking €[X] in monthly revenue from your GMB listing. The service costs €300, so if it helps you capture just one additional customer per month, it pays for itself."**

**"Plus, you'll make better business decisions when you can see exactly what's working and what isn't. Most of my clients tell me the insights alone are worth the investment."**

### **The Urgency Close**

**"I'm launching this with my existing clients first, and I'm offering a special rate of €200 per month for the first three months if you start this week. After that, it goes to the regular €300 rate."**

**"What questions do you have about the dashboard?"**

---

## Objection Handling

### **"€300 is expensive"**
**"I understand budget is important. Let me ask you this - how much is one new customer worth to your business? [Wait for answer] So if this dashboard helps you get just [X] additional customers per month through better GMB performance, it pays for itself. Plus, you're already generating €[X] monthly from GMB according to our tracking."**

### **"I don't need all these features"**
**"That's fair. Which part is most valuable to you - the real-time performance tracking or the ROI calculations? [Listen] The thing is, they work together. You need the performance data to calculate ROI, and you need ROI data to make smart business decisions. It's like having a car with just an engine but no steering wheel."**

### **"I need to think about it"**
**"Absolutely, this is an important decision. What specifically do you need to think about? [Listen] Would it help if I set up a trial account so you can use it for a week and see the value firsthand? No commitment, just experience how it works for your business."**

### **"Can I get a discount?"**
**"The €200 launch rate for three months is already a 33% discount. After seeing these ROI numbers, I'm confident you'll see the value. How about this - if after the first month you don't feel it's worth €200, I'll refund that month and we'll cancel. Fair enough?"**

### **"I'm already getting reports from you"**
**"You're right, and I'll keep providing those. But this gives you so much more - real-time data instead of waiting for monthly reports, ROI calculations you can't get anywhere else, and competitive intelligence that helps you stay ahead. It's like the difference between getting a bank statement once a month versus checking your balance anytime you want."**

## Closing Sequence

### **If They Say Yes**
**"Fantastic! I'll set up your account today and send you the login details within 24 hours. The first month is €200, and I'll send you an invoice. You'll be able to see all your data immediately, and I'll schedule a quick training call to walk you through everything. Sound good?"**

### **If They Need Time**
**"I understand. How about this - let me set up a demo account with your data so you can try it for a week. No payment required. If you like it, we'll convert it to a paid account at the launch rate. If not, no worries. Does that work?"**

### **If They Say No**
**"No problem at all. I appreciate you taking the time to look at it. I'll keep tracking your performance manually and including it in our monthly check-ins. If you change your mind, just let me know. The launch pricing is available through [date]."**
